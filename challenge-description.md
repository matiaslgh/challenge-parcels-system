# Technical Assessment

## Short Description

You have been assigned a project to develop an automated system for handling parcels within a delivery company. The goal is to streamline the internal processes at the distribution center by assigning parcels to different departments based on their weight and value. It's important to design the system in a way that allows for easy adaptation to potential future changes in the department structure.

## Features

### Feature 1

The current handling rules for parcels are as follows:

- Parcels weighing up to 1 kg should be assigned to the "Mail" department.
- Parcels weighing up to 10 kg should be assigned to the "Regular" department.
- Parcels weighing over 10 kg should be assigned to the "Heavy" department.

### Feature 2

Parcels with a value exceeding â‚¬1000 should undergo a review process by the "Insurance" department before being processed by other departments.

### Feature 3 (optional)

As part of the long-term plan, the company intends to commercialize the software and offer it as a subscription-based product. The system should allow for customizable business rules to accommodate different customer requirements.
